# Skills Index

This directory contains installable skill packages grouped by skill family. `catalog.json` is the machine-readable registry for package names, source folders, and supported target agents.

Discovery and documentation rules for adding future skills:

1. Put each new family under `skills/<family>/`.
2. Put each installable package under `skills/<family>/<skill-name>/` where folder name equals `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name`.
3. Register the package and target agents in `skills/catalog.json`, then update this index and root `README.md` / `INSTALL.md`.
4. A package is discovered by `make all` only at the exact `skills/<family>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` depth.
5. Use `README.md` for family overview and `USAGE.md` for concrete prompt/install/operation examples when needed.
6. Add tests or validation commands when the skill ships scripts.
7. Put family-only sync checks under `skills/<family>/scripts/check_*_sync.py`.
8. Run `make all` before committing.
